##This application uses jwt to generate web tokens which can be used for logging in to the application.

End point urls:
For regular user:
http://localhost:3000/library/v1/books/ HTTP GET
http://localhost:3000/library/v1/book/2 HTP GET
more routes available in index.js file under routes folder

For admin:
http://localhost:3000/library/v1/admin/users  HTTP GET
http://localhost:3000/library/v1/admin/user/2 HTTP GET

=======================================================================
There is no validation implemented for logging in to the application, however to view book details or user details validated user is required.
login URL: http://localhost:3000/login HTTP POST

{
"username" : "jyo@innovify.com",
"password" : "pass123"
